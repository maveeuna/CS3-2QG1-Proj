                <h1>Stereotyping Abuse and Its Impact</h1>
				<h3>By:Francis Matthew Bretana (11/23/24)</h3>

                <p>
					Gender-based violence affects both women and men, but women and girls are the most common victims. It is a serious violation of basic human rights, causing physical harm, health problems, and lasting emotional trauma. Men who face abuse may feel embarrassed to speak out because of social stigma, which keeps the cycle of violence going. Toxic masculinity also makes abuse seem normal and pressures men to act aggressively. This issue needs to be solved because gender-based violence threatens people’s safety, well-being, and equality. Reducing abuse creates safer and healthier communities for everyone. It also helps stop the cycle of violence and protects future generations.
                </p>
                <p>
					To fix this issue, we need to raise awareness about gender equality, respect, and the harm caused by abuse. Laws must be stronger and properly enforced to protect victims and punish those who hurt others. Better access to support services like shelters, counseling, and hotlines is essential for victims to get help and recover. It’s also important to involve men and boys in the solution. They can challenge harmful behaviors and help promote healthy, respectful relationships. By taking these steps, we can work toward a world free from gender-based violence, where everyone is treated fairly and with respect.
