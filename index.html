				<h2>Why Gender Inequality?</h2>
				<p>
					Gender inequality is a major social issue that harms human rights and hinders economic growth. When women are left out of the workforce or paid less
					for the same work, it reduces productivity and innovation, holding society back. Tackling this inequality empowers marginalized groups and promotes social
					development, creating a more inclusive environment. It also connects to other important challenges like poverty, education, and health, making it vital for
					overall progress. By promoting gender equality, we can improve family dynamics and community health, benefiting future generations. Ultimately, striving
					for gender equality is essential for building a fairer and more prosperous world for everyone.

				<h2>Problems of Gender Inequality</h2>
				<p>
					Women face many challenges that limit their opportunities and well-being. They often earn less than men for the same jobs, which can lead to poverty
					and financial dependence. Women are also underrepresented in many careers and leadership roles, making it harder to advance. Many girls have limited access
					to education due to cultural or financial barriers, affecting their future. Violence and harassment against women are common, affecting their safety and freedom.
					Access to healthcare, especially for reproductive health, is often lacking, leading to poor health outcomes. Traditional gender roles further limit women’s choices,
					and fewer women in politics means they have less say in decisions that impact their lives. Women from marginalized groups face extra challenges due to overlapping
					issues like race or social status, which can make inequality even worse.
